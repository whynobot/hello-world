Diving into GitHub // Hello World // First Repository

I am very excited to learn as much helpful information about GitHub as I can from this lesson.  I am super thankful to have been shown this website, these lessons and this learning technique from a dear friend.  I have a vision and goal of adding 24/7 radio to my website.  I am a veteran DJ of 20 years and am shifting my focus to radio from parties and clubs.  Changing gears has been very fun and a huge learning experience.  I'm trying to push myself to go outside of my comfort zone and it has alraedy been very rewarding.  I had my first FM radio show this year broadcasted out of London, UK remotely from Northern California.  The response to the show was great and I was truly blown away.  I'm looking to create my own radio station and to host this threw my website.  GitHub and coding my own software was recomended by a friend and I'm taking the recomendation to heart.  I have a serious goal of teaching myself plus utilizing sites like GitHub as well as schooling to obtain the know how for this project.  I have learned to be open and talk about my goals and dreams with friends and family.  Doing so has brought me here to this site and lesson.  I could not be more excited and thankful.
